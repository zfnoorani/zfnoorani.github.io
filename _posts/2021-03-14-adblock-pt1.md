I want to take a deep dive into the most common ad blocking methods and build some basic implementations.
I have a high level understanding of how it's accomplished, but I haven't gone much deeper than that.
Between DNS and DOM hacking, I think there's a lot to learn.

Of course, you shouldn't use anything I write, and fall back on the tried and true [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), and [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/).
This is just a learning exercise.

But first let me get political and a bit conspiratorial with you, and explain why you should use an ad blocker.
Then I'll back off and talk about some available methods at a high level.

## It's your right.

When I mention to folks that you can block ads, the most common reaction is, "Isn't that illegal?"

No! [Not for lack of trying](https://adblockplus.org/blog/five-and-oh-look-another-lawsuit-upholds-users-rights-online), however.

Frankly, as someone who is not a lawyer, I don't know much more beyond this, legally speaking.
I'll let you hit ~~Google~~ DuckDuckGo to see the various [sources](https://whatismyipaddress.com/ad-blocker-legal) that contain more legal jargon than I can supply.

Here's a reason it's not illegal in more ideological terms.
When you visit a website, you are downloading HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to your machine.
This is code that determines how the website is presented.
The code is executed on your machine, then text, pictures, and colors appear nice and orderly.

This code might reach out to a third party server and request more HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, such as those that present ads.
That code is executed on your machine, and then you are helpfully made aware of hot singles in your area.

Ad blocking is exercising precise control over what code is executed on your device.
It is no different from pressing F12 to mess with the DOM, installing a browser extension, or even scrolling the page.
After all, you own your device, despite many corporations' attempts to violate this.

Besides, this isn't [*Black Mirror*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_Million_Merits).
Nobody can compel you to view an ad.

## Ads are bad for society.
Ads, and those who create them, have no consciousness of the ill effects on society they have.
The advertising industry is borderline unregulated.

There is a plethora of research that studies the link between [advertising and poor body image](https://byedl.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/88/2020/10/ESP-464-Media-Effects-and-Body-Image-Perceptions-on-Youth.pdf).
This is even more troubling considering children's proximity to ads, especially ones that [target them](https://www.popsci.com/ads-kids-apps-games/).

They are placed in ways that [blur the line](https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/squint-and-youll-click-it/) between [legitimate content and advertising](https://paleofuture.com/blog/2013/8/7/the-history-of-ads-disguised-as-news), to trick you into clicking them.

[Ads violate your privacy](https://theory.stanford.edu/~korolova/Privacy_violations_using_microtargeted_ads.pdf).
Your data is sold, [or provided in the case of social media](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/19/how-facebook-ad-tracking-and-targeting-works.html), to advertising platforms.
Even visiting certain websites can [provide this data](https://medium.com/analytics-and-data/cookies-tracking-and-pixels-where-does-your-web-data-comes-from-ff5d9b8bc8f7).

They are the backbone of [surveillance capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism), a racket employed by social media companies that [threatens our rights and democracy](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/04/shoshana-zuboff-surveillance-capitalism-assault-human-automomy-digital-privacy). 

Paying is [not enough to escape them](https://old.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/j2xrts/apparently_spending_2500_on_a_samsung_tv_doesnt/).

Ads are a [malware distribution vector](https://www.extremetech.com/internet/220696-forbes-forces-readers-to-turn-off-ad-blockers-promptly-serves-malware).

At the core of it, internet ads are engineered to psychologically manipulate you and violate your privacy.
You are bombarded with incomplete information, sensationalized titles, malware, false realities, grifts, and tricks.
Advertising and social media companies accrue offensive amounts of wealth while polarizing and destroying our society.

They have zero incentive to do better. We must take matters into our own hands.

## B-b-but how will companies survive?

*I'm aware of the irony of using YouTube for this.*

With the rants and conspiracies out of the way, let's move on to the technical details.

## DNS ad blocking.
There are two dominant methods to ad blocking.
The first is through DNS manipulation.

[Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) is a means of mapping IP addresses to user friendly hostnames.
Internet communication happens through IP address, however trying to remember 172.217.6.110 for Google is inconvenient.
Thus your computer when presented with the address `google.com` will first call out to a DNS server to discover Google's IP address.
Then communication can proceed.

When your computer is told to download an ad by the crusty code downloaded from a web page, it will need to translate something like `adservice.google.com` to an IP address.

What if the DNS server responds with complete garbage to the request `adservice.google.com`?
As it turns out, the request will silently fail, and the main website will generally ignore it and load anyway.
This technique is known as [DNS sinkhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_sinkhole). 

All we need is some way to set up a DNS server that sinkholes known ad domain names, and some way to tell our computer to use that DNS server.
Unfortunately, we aren't the first people with this idea. 
Pi-hole is one possible DNS server, and changing your DNS server [depends on your platform](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using).

There are publicly available ad blocking DNS servers, such as [Alternate DNS](https://alternate-dns.com/), but I don't suggest this out of privacy concerns.

## Browser-based ad blocking.
DNS manipulation is not perfect.
It doesn't protect against ads rendered server-side, and is inconvenient due to a reliance on a second system.
It also doesn't help if ads are served from the same domain as the main website.

Another method is by identifying specific HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements that are undesirable, and removing or blocking them from being downloaded.

The usual design involves a list of carefully crafted filters that identify these elements, and a browser extension written to parse these filters and remove any elements that match them.
This is how uBlock Origin works.
It is not strictly an ad blocker, rather it is a content blocker that can be configured to block ads with the correct filters.

It is impossible for one person to create filters for all ads in existence.
Curating a list of filters is a community effort.
uBlock Origin [publishes their filters](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets) for all to see and contribute to.

## Other methods.
The other available methods are too inconvenient, ineffective, or simply not as good as DNS or content blocking.

A fun method is not ad blocking at all, rather it is [data poisoning](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/05/1020376/resist-big-tech-surveillance-data/).
Given that ads track you based on who you visit and what you click on, what if you click on absolutely everything?
The ad company's data on you becomes inaccurate.
If everybody did it, all their metrics would be off.

[AdNauseum](https://adnauseam.io/) is a browser extension that does this for you.
It was even [banned](https://www.fastcompany.com/3068920/google-adnauseam-ad-blocking-war) by the Google Chrome Web Store.
Google's excuse for doing so is bewildering, but given their massive advertising presence, I'm sure you can imagine the real reason.

This method is delightfully malicious.
Even though this is not strictly in scope, it is a technique I'd like to explore for this series.

## Stay tuned.
This has just been a high level overview of the motivations and methods behind ad blocking.
In some follow up posts, we'll take a look at building out tiny implementations of each of the common methods using the appropriate tools.
