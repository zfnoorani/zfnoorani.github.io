When using a homelab to build marketable skills, evaluate if you really need bare metal.

"Build a homelab" is a common trope I see in IT and ops focused communities for folks wanting to start or level up their career.
I can't deny the impact that a homelab has had on my own career.
Nor can I deny the satisfaction of owning a tall tower of [blinkenlights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinkenlights).

*6x HP DL380 G5, 1-2 Xeon Dual Core CPUs, 4-16GB DDR2 RAM, 0-6 15K SAS disks each.*
*Yes, I bottomed out on every bump.*

But you should be mindful of your goals and the state of the industry, lest you find yourself with 500 pounds of servers in the trunk of your 1997 Lincoln Town Car.

Take heed of several lessons I learned in this endeavor.

### You probably won't touch production hardware.
A majority of IT jobs won't even let you in the datacenter.
Even if you run workloads on bare metal.
The only folks allowed in are technicians.

This is for good reason.
The servers containing people's personal data should be as off-limits as possible.

### Hardware wastes your time.
By the same token, fiddling with hardware is probably not worthwhile.
I'm never going to get paid to swap a disk, upgrade RAM, or wire up racks.
Are you?

### There's probably better alternatives.
There are definitely subfields where owning a physical homelab has some merit.
There may be alternatives, however.

Networking is an area where you might see value in having direct access to hardware.
Instead, you should use [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).
You can build virtual networks of greater scale and sophistication than is feasible with a home lab, for free.

For everything else, run it in the cloud.
With clever usage, your workloads should fit into [multiple cloud provider's free tiers](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev#major-cloud-providers).
Any charges you do incur should be a fraction of the cost of hardware.

Yes, a 4C/16GB AWS EC2 instance on-demand is about $100/month, not including EBS.
Yes, an equivalent machine could be bought on eBay for $150.
But, does your workload need 4C/16GB (there's a reason the instance is called `*.xlarge`)?
Does it need it 24/7?

Note that it looks like the only reasonable option at the moment for running VMware vSphere is bare metal. Let your checkbook roar.

*The trunk unloaded, plus a few other servers I already owned and a disk box.*

### So is hardware good for anything?
For my home lab, a project was an AWS EC2-ish service equivalent, built from scratch.
I learned a massive amount about Linux, VMware vSphere, Ansible, Terraform, and Go.

There's tons of learning potential in building app infrastructure from absolutely nothing, end to end.
This is hard to replicate in a cloud environment, where you are insulated from the networking and hypervisor.

That being said, all my development took place on a single used Dell T420 tower server.
All 8 of the other servers sat in the garage.

### If you still want to run bare metal...
Do not expose anything to the internet.
Do not port-forward on your router.
We live in an era marred by zero-day vulnerabilities and ransomware.
Internet facing services must stay far away from the machines that hold your family photos and bank information.

(If you haven't realized, even this site is running on GitHub Pages and my images are hosted on S3.)

If your workload demands incoming internet access (e.g. cost efficient game servers), isolate your machine from your home network [on a DMZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)).
Then follow even more best practices, without exception:
- [Never port forward RDP to the internet](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1994762-remote-computer-access-over-the-internet-using-rdp-what-could-go-wrong). Burn any document that even suggests this.
- Use SSH public-key authentication, when applicable.
- Make offline or cloud backups of any data you care about.
- Update internet facing systems frequently.
- Do not store PII or valuable data on an internet facing machine.

*Sadly, this is the only picture I have of my rack, with PII crudely blacked out.*
*I can practically hear this picture.*

In short, you should carefully consider whether your career trajectory requires that you work with bare metal, or at a layer close to it.
If it does, be smart about what you acquire.
If you need much more than a single discrete machine running virtual machines, you're probably doing it wrong.
If you are building on bare metal, then be vigilant about the security of your home network.
