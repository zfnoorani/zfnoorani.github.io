Microsoft didn't end the career of Clippy, the notorious Microsoft Office Assistant.
He's doing pretty well--and it's not because I'm paying him to stay on the front page of my blog.

For those, *cough*, younger than I am, [Clippit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant) aka Clippy, was made in the late 90s.
He's essentially a predecessor to Siri and Cortana, except for Microsoft Office.
Imagine them, except always butting in and giving profoundly unhelpful advice.

Oh, I guess some things never change.

Since being discontinued in Office XP in 2001, and because he's almost universally hated, he's had a tough time finding work. 
Appearances in many [cameos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbon_Hero_2), and [memes](https://junkee.com/clippy-microsoft-bob-paperclip/215811) helps pay the bills.

But few know of our old friend's exploits in the *nix realm.
Let's take a look.

## Vigor
[Vigor](http://vigor.sourceforge.net/), which rhymes with Igor, is Clippy, but for the `vi` text editor.
Last released in 2002, Vigor is a parody program which pokes fun at Clippy's propensity to get in the way and be irritating.

There are [http://vigor.sourceforge.net/screenshots/](screenshots) of Vigor in action, but I want to run him on my machine.

That's easier said than done, however, as this codebase predates Fedora 33 by 20 years.
For kicks I tried compiling it natively anyway, and the results were as you'd expect.
The build script refuses to see my X11 shared libraries.

I tried a virtual machine of Red Hat Linux 6.
No, not Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, [Red Hat Linux 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux).
Unfortunately, I couldn't find the correct matrix of libvirt/QEMU settings that jived well.

I'll give this a deeper try another time.
I'd love to get Vigor to run on modern Linux.

## vscode-pets
Visual Studio Code is home to a few Clippy-related extensions.

There's [vscode-pets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonybaloney.vscode-pets) mainly is meant to put a small cat or dog on your Visual Studio Code instance to keep you company. But Clippy is also an option.

The artwork is adorable, the artist [Marc Duiker](https://twitter.com/marcduiker) is quite talented.

He mostly keeps to himself in his own pane, occasionally busting out a skateboard or reacting to your cursor. 

We also have [Clippy](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fleshywaffles.vs-code-clippy) for VSCode. 
He'll wrap up your LSP errors in some snark and present them in a nostalgic speech bubble.

With some refinement, and perhaps extending to cover all of the Microsoft Agents, this could be a really enjoyable extension.

## Kakoune
The [Kakoune](https://kakoune.org/) text editor, is awesome for many reasons.
The fact that it has Clippy is one of them.
He's the default `ncurses-assistant` which wraps help text in a speech bubble. 
No frills, no snark.

If you're using [kak-lsp](https://github.com/kak-lsp/kak-lsp), he'll even wrap your LSP messages for you.

Alright, he's looking a little rough around the edges.
When I said `ncurses-assistant`, that was with an emphasis on the `ncurses`.

Still, this is what Clippy does best.
He adds character to an otherwise dull computer program, whether a text editor or word processor.

## Summary
We've seen some of the more esoteric roles that Clippy has taken on.
Maybe some day he'll return to the mainstream, unburdened by his failed career at Microsoft, not as a meme but as a true facilitator of work.
